The platform eliminates middlemen and creates direct connections, ensuring fair wages for workers and reliable service for employers.

## Key Features

- **Location-Based Job Matching**: Connects workers with nearby job opportunities
- **Dual Dashboards**: Separate interfaces for workers and employers
- **Verification System**: Government ID verification for both workers and employers
- **Trust Scoring**: Rating system to track worker reliability and quality
- **Email Verification**: Secure authentication using email verification codes
- **WhatsApp Integration**: No app download required - communicate via WhatsApp
- **Job Management**: Post, search, apply, and manage job listings
- **Profile Management**: Detailed worker profiles with skills and experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (converted to JavaScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with express-session
- **Email**: Nodemailer for verification emails
- **Storage**: File uploads with Multer
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query

## Development Guidelines

### Code Conversion

The codebase has been converted from TypeScript to JavaScript using ES module syntax. When working with the code:

1. Use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) in all JavaScript files
2. Add `.js` extension when importing local files
3. Be mindful of the module type in package.json (`"type": "module"`)

### Database Access

The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Key database components:

1. Schema definitions in `shared/schema.js`
2. Database connection in `server/db.js`
3. Data access layer in `server/storage.js`

### Authentication Flow

1. User registration: `/api/register`
2. Email verification: `/api/verify-email`
3. Login: `/api/login`
4. Session persistence with PostgreSQL session store
5. Protected routes requiring authentication
